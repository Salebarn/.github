# Accelerating the negotiation is what Salebarn is about.

The SECRET SAUCE of social media is the USER ... or the interactions between USERs ... the interactions are the basis of accelerated negotiation ... not just search, but closing deals, fulfilling orders, ensuring that customers were genuinely satisfied and finding out what to do better next time.

# Reputation improvement is what accelerated negotiation is all about. 

Social media biz gets it blatantly wrong by imagining that USER data is the product ... it's as bad as old, antiquated livestock auctions that imagine it's all about getting the highest bid for the animals that were trucked to a disease exchange so that they could be in front of idiot bidders ... the accelerated negotiation is not about fast talking -- it's about rapidly making things better to improve and solidify reputations with constantly improving quality.
