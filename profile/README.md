## Accelerated Negotiation

Auctioneering allows for a group of ***knowledgeable QUALIFIED bidders*** who are interested in an item [because they work or do business in the product industry] and have the ability to complete a transaction, ie have funds to pay for what they are bidding on ... to RAPIDLY determine the fair market value of an item.

There is NO OTHER METHOD that is more efficient at negotiating fair price for an item than auction ... that is why auctioneering is a matter of accelerating the negotiation to the satisfaction of all ***QUALIFIED*** parties concerned.
